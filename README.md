# Get Data from SQL Server, clean it and make predictions with Python and create an Interactive Prediction App with Tableau
SQL / Python / Tableau Project - Connecting to my local SQL Server using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas SQL, I use queries to clean up the data and update it into my server. Then I use Python and ScikitLearn to compute machine learning algorithms in order to predict if the customer is going to accept the marketing campaign or not. Finally, using TabPy, I upload the models into tableau and create an interactive dashboard designed as an application in order to make it usable for end users and realize predictions on new customers regarding some manual input information. 

**Interactive DashBoard:**

*NOTE: To make the Interactive app working on your computer, you will need to install Tabpy and run it first. For more information, please look at the Jupyter Notebook explaining all the steps including installing TabPy and connecting it to Tableau.*
