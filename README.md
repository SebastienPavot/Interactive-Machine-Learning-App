# Interactive-Machine-Learning-App
SQL / Python / Tableau - Connecting to my local SQL Server using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas SQL, I use queries to clean up the data and update it into my server. Then I use Python and SickitLearn to compute machine learning algorithms in order to predict if the customer is going to accept the marketing campaign or not. Finally, using TabPy, I upload the models into tableau and create an interactive dashboard designed as an application in order to make it usable for end users and realize predictions on new customers regarding some manual input information.
